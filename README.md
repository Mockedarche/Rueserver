# Rueserver
This is a template for a home server idea I have. Essentially a mysql server that is connected to a server which accepts clients.

Goals - 
    This server will eventually act as a server that allows clients on MY network to add pieces to a MYSQL server.
    The goal will be for various smart devices to add data to a server where I can make a web interface to show that data.
    Currently the thinking will be pi zero w's with temperature, humidity, etc data submitting their data so I can see
    fluctuations throughout my house. Eventually i'd like to make my own humidifiers, zone cooling, etc.
    

Working on client side stuff going to get it working on a pi zero w and get sensor gathering done.
